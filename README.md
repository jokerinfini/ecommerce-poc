### **E-Commerce POC Backend**

#### **Overview**
This repository contains the backend implementation for an e-commerce platform proof-of-concept (POC). The backend is built using Go (Gin + GORM + SQLite) and provides RESTful APIs for various services such as authentication, product management, order processing, payment handling, notifications, and more. The frontend is built with React (Vite + React Bootstrap).

The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, following best practices for API development and integration with third-party services.
